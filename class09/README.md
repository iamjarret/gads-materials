Intro to Data Science Class08: 
=======

## Evaluating Classifier Models, The ROC Curve

- Announcements/Questions: 
  	-Rob out next week
- Review Dataexplor05
- Quick Review of Logistic Regression & Naive Bayes Classfiers
- Intro the ROC Curve
- Demo Sklearn ROC Curve
- Lab: Practice
- Some utility code for accessing APIs

## Objectives

* Know how to interpret an ROC curve
* Have a sense for tuning classifier model thresholds to get desired result
* Know how to produce an ROC curve in sklearn

## Homework

### Lightening Talks!

Prepare a Lightening talk on your Term Project to be delivered in class Wednesday

Three parts:
1. Describe your project-- what question are you hoping to answer
2. Describe your data and share results of any EDA done so far
3. Describe any difficulties you are having or anticipate having

Constraints:
-Maximum of three minutes
-Maximum of one slide
