## Objectives

* Know how to evaluate classification models
* Understand theory behind LogisticRegression
* Know how to use sklearn's LogisticRegression class

## Homework

* *Term Project*
  Create a text file/markdown/pdf/etc. and answer the following questions:
  1. What is your topic? Can you phrase your topic in the form of a question that you hope to answer?
  2. What do you plan to use as your source of data? Do you have a sense for how large your dataset is? Any other characteristics you know of?
  3. What tools or topics do you hope to learn and demonstrate by the end? In other words, what are your learning objectives?
